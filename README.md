With the aim of revolutionizing medical diagnosis, this project attempts to harness the power of deep learning techniques to create a virtual interface to identify Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, is an important public health problem. Early detection is essential to manage disease progression, but remains a difficult task. This project is an important step in meeting this challenge.
To develop this virtual interface, I started by using a dataset from Kaggle, a well-known platform for data science and machine learning. The dataset consisting of MRI scans became the basis for training and validating a complex deep learning model. Inspired by the research paper titled “Multi-label classification of Alzheimer's disease stages from correlated connectivity data based on resting-state fMRI and deep learning”  by Abdulaziz Alorf and Muhammad Usman Ghani Khan, I  built a complete model. 
This model acts as a multi-label classifier, capable of distinguishing different stages of Alzheimer's disease from MRI images. The importance of this model lies in achieving an exceptional validation accuracy of up to 96%. Such accuracy highlights the potential of deep learning as a tool to aid in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
